# A Pattern Language for the Pluriverse

A manifesto for new internet dreams, with communally-sourced contributions of visions for these futures.

> We created this artifact with the hope that collaborative dialogue and action centered on pluriversality can offer an alternative to the digital monocultures of the present, and help catalyze an ecosystem strategy towards meaningful digital interdependence. We share this call as a beginning, not as an end; we recognize that change does not and cannot come from language alone. We hope to contribute, in community and in the ecosystem, to a clearer set of technologies, infrastructures, institutions, and processes that realize the ethic of the pluriverse in the concrete and material.

Includes patterns for the future of the web, alternative networks, pluralist futures ‚Äî building blocks for interoperability, agency, voice, engagenent and attention, privacy, regeneration, commons, and maintenance and care.
